# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

For this week's Challenge, your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.


## What was the reason for this repo?

First of all, Horiseon contacted me to improve the SEO (Search Engine Optimization). The scout rule was followed to leave the code more improved than when I found it. Moreover, a couple of things were done to the html file which I belive to be an improvment over what I had when I started. 

- The title of the website has been improved. 
- The nav tag was changed from the div tag to improve understading of code.
- Instead of div, the actual semantic element 'header' was used to describe 	  that section.
- section class hero, benefits, and footer instead of just 'div'.
- alt attributes where added to each picture in the code.
- search-engine-optimization picture was fixed to make the top text click and 		navigate to the correct and corresponding field. 
The website is now functional with hopefully no errors. There is now potential to move forward with more features in the future.

I learned a lot about how to properly use the 'section' tags and how to properly format the code. 


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN I find that they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
